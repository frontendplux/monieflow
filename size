In CSS frameworks like **Bootstrap**, the `sm` breakpoint refers to **small devices** (typically smartphones). The width in pixels for `sm` is:

- **`sm` = 576px and up**

That means:
- Anything **below 576px** is considered **extra small (xs)**.
- At **576px and above**, the layout switches to the `sm` breakpoint rules.

Here’s a quick reference table for Bootstrap breakpoints:

| Breakpoint | Prefix | Min Width (px) |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Extra small | `xs` | `<576` |
| Small | `sm` | `≥576` |
| Medium | `md` | `≥768` |
| Large | `lg` | `≥992` |
| Extra large | `xl` | `≥1200` |
| Extra extra large | `xxl` | `≥1400` |

So when you see `sm`, think **576px minimum width**.  

Since you’re working on your **monieflow project** in phpMyAdmin and a Facebook-style UI, this breakpoint will control how your feeds/reels layout adapts on mobile screens.  

Would you like me to show you a **responsive grid example** using `sm`, `md`, and `lg` so you can see how your feeds table could look across devices?
